		Real-time global illumination (GI) probe.

	<description>
		[GIProbe]s are used to provide high-quality real-time indirect light to scenes. They precompute the effect of objects that emit light and the effect of static geometry to simulate the behavior of complex light in real-time. [GIProbe]s need to be baked before using, however, once baked, dynamic objects will receive light from them. Further, lights can be fully dynamic or baked.
		Having [GIProbe]s in a scene can be expensive, the quality of the probe can be turned down in exchange for better performance in the [ProjectSettings] using [member ProjectSettings.rendering/quality/gi_probes/quality].

				Bakes the effect from all [GeometryInstance3D]s marked with [constant GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_BAKED] and [Light3D]s marked with either [constant Light3D.BAKE_DYNAMIC] or [constant Light3D.BAKE_STATIC]. If [code]create_visual_debug[/code] is [code]true[/code], after baking the light, this will generate a [MultiMesh] that has a cube representing each solid cell with each cube colored to the cell's albedo color. This can be used to visualize the [GIProbe]'s data and debug any issues that may be occurring.

		<member name="data" type="GIProbeData" setter="set_probe_data" getter="get_probe_data">
			The [GIProbeData] resource that holds the data for this [GIProbe].

		<member name="extents" type="Vector3" setter="set_extents" getter="get_extents" default="Vector3( 10, 10, 10 )">
			The size of the area covered by the [GIProbe]. If you make the extents larger without increasing the subdivisions with [member subdiv], the size of each cell will increase and result in lower detailed lighting.

			Number of times to subdivide the grid that the [GIProbe] operates on. A higher number results in finer detail and thus higher visual quality, while lower numbers result in better performance.

	<constants>
		<constant name="SUBDIV_64" value="0" enum="Subdiv">
			Use 64 subdivisions. This is the lowest quality setting, but the fastest. Use it if you can, but especially use it on lower-end hardware.

		<constant name="SUBDIV_128" value="1" enum="Subdiv">
			Use 128 subdivisions. This is the default quality setting.

		<constant name="SUBDIV_512" value="3" enum="Subdiv">
			Use 512 subdivisions. This is the highest quality setting, but the slowest. On lower-end hardware this could cause the GPU to stall.
